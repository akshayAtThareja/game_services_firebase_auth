4. Enable Google Play Games as a sign-in provider:
Find your project's web server client ID and client secret. The web server client ID identifies your Firebase project to the Google Play auth servers.

To find these values:

Open your Firebase project in the Google APIs console credentials page.
In the OAuth 2.0 client IDs section, open the Web client (auto created by Google Service) details page. This page lists your web server client ID and secret.
Then, in the Firebase console, open the Authentication section.

On the Sign in method tab, enable the Play Games sign-in provider. You will need to specify your project's web server client ID and client secret, which you got from the APIs console.
